            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is a Miniſtry which poureth out it ſelf in torrents of affection, liſts up its voice like a trumpet, comes to the heart in the demonſtration of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit; thunders out the Judgements of God againſt all that is called fleſh, and not ſpirit, ſtrikes at the very root of every tree which brings not forth fruit to God; labours mightily to deſponſate ſouls to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holds forth none, and nothing ſo much as Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98937:17"/>
                  <p>To the ſecond Query I anſwer thus, in ſeven Grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such a Miniſtry will cry down ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Will cry up Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Will cry up Zeal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Will take away the Vail which is over all mens faces.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Will take away all excuſes and vain conceits.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Will acquaint men with the abſolute neceſſity of believing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Will inform them of that ſtrictneſs of living which Chriſt requireth of all that will enter into Life everlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ground.</hi> It will cry down Sin, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. as thus; it will tell men, that they which do ſuch things as they do, commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and whoredom, and all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and laſciviouſneſs, with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; do lie, ſteal, pour in ſtrong drink, and will be drunk, and glut themſelves with exceſſive eating, live in uſury, in the ſin of covetouſneſs, of anger, of envy, of pride; without fear, without remorſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; are worthy of death, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of damnation, and ſhall never inherit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98937:17"/>the Kingdom of God; according to that dreadful Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. Thus ſuch a Miniſtry cryeth out againſt all ſorts of Sins and Sinners; who when they hear them cry out ſo, what ſins will they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſs, that eternal Life they may not miſs? And what evils will they not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, that Heaven they may take? When a man underſtands, that either he muſt loſe his life, or his leg, or arm, or right hand, or right eye, though his leg be dear to him, his arm dear, his right hand dear, his right eye dear, yet will he loſe any of theſe dear things, or all, rather than life; becauſe his Chyrurgion tells him, that elſe he muſt die: So poor Sinners, when they are told by the Chyrurgions of their ſouls, that either they muſt loſe their beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sins, which are as dear to them as their legs, their arms, their right eyes, right hands, or loſe Heaven if they will keep them; they will, with God's bleſſing, do any thing rather than die; forgoe any ſin rather than go to Hell; loſe any profit rather than Heaven; Heaven being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, abſolutely, indiſputably better than both their eyes, both hands, both legs, both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98937:18"/>arms; in a word, than all that is near or dear to them in all this worlds circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ground.</hi> It will cry up Heaven; as the Baptiſt came crying, and ſaying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, Mat.</hi> 3.2. and as Chriſt himſelf came preaching, and ſaying in my Text, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers Violence;</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. which when poor ſouls hear, how they will be ſtartled with Gods Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; how they will come, as thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. confeſſing their ſins, and acknowledging their former of citances and neglectings of Life and Salvation, and being ready to do any thing to do well hereafter, and to be ſaved, as thoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, if this were a Sea-town, and a Veſſel ſhould arrive here from beyond the Seas, and a Cryer ſhould be ſent up and down to cry, That if any will buy, &amp; take eſtates worth thouſands, in a goodly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for a ſmall matter, yea for nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, he may now be carried over in that Veſſel, and buy, and take as much Land as he will, and as cheap as he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; O! how would thoſe of your Town,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98937:18"/>who have but little or no eſtates, and are in want, and have but little or no money, with both hands imbrace ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp; take ſuch a proffer and advantage, and embark themſelves to be gone, and to take ſuch eſtates in ſo goodly a Country, and to inhabit ſuch ſtately Seats? This now is the caſe of poor ſouls, we Miniſters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive with our Veſſels, I ſhould ſay our Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-preaching, which we carry in earthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels, at your Towns, at your Pariſhes; at your Temples we turn Cryers, being for that end ſent, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1. and bid to cry; and cry up and down in your Towns and ſolemn Aſſemblies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho, if any man will buy cheap, and take Heaven cheap, or an eſtate in Heaven, worth not only thouſands, but whole worlds, and deſires to have a goodly ſeat indeed, let him come with us, and ſaile with us, and go, and take Heaven, and take it freely;</hi> or thus (as I alleadged the words above) <hi>Let him that is athirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely:</hi> and therefore how may we ſuppoſe that poor needy ſouls, and ſuch as have no money, that is, nothing of their own to ſtand upon, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98937:19"/>55.1, 2. and have any deſires to be ſaved, and to be ſo well ſeated and provided for, will, by God's bleſſing, going with our preaching, ſtrive and ſtir, and uſe all means poſſible, to purchaſe ſuch an eſtate, and ſuch a ſtately ſeat, at ſo cheap and eaſie a rate, going with us, and going away from all that they have, and from whatſoever is near and dear to them, to be ſo near to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Ground.</hi> It cries up Zeal; ſaying, as it is written, <hi>Enter ye at the ſtrait Gate; for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leads to Deſtruction; and many there be which go in thereat: becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leads to Life; and few there be that find it, Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>And, ſo run, that you may obtain,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. and, <hi>be zealous and repent, Rev.</hi> 3.19. which when it is earneſtly &amp; powerfully preached and preſſed upon a people, and ſounds into their ears, ſo awakeneth their ſlumbering Conſciences, as that they cannot ſleep, as they were wont in their Pues, nor be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but muſt needs ſtir, and needs look about, and begin (with God's bleſſing) to take the ſame courſe that Saints take, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98937:19"/>they may take Heaven; it being with them then, as it was with thoſe dead dry bones in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> for as there, when the Prophet propheſied, <hi>There was a noiſe, and behold a ſhaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone,</hi> ver. 7. So here, when God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters propheſie, and preach with power, there uſually will be a noiſe; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all was quiet, one crying one thing, another another, <hi>and behold a ſhaking;</hi> for ſuch Miniſters make Drunkards, and Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and unclean perſons, and careleſs ones ſhake, in their ſeats; and then bone comes to his bone: my meaning is this, men come together, crying, and ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> as the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. Again, bone comes to his bone, in that thoſe which are out of joynt, and out of order, and out of the Body of Chriſt, come to be reſtored, joyned, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, united with God, with Chriſt, with Chriſtians, I mean good Chriſtians, that they may be ſaved: or thus, as when there is a fire in a houſe, ſeen, and cryed by night, men will be ſtartled at it, and rouſed, and raiſed; ſo when the Fire of Zeal is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in God's Houſe, and cryed, and ſeen
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98937:20"/>by ſuch as were aſleep, it being night and dark with them, by reaſon of the darkneſs which is in them, they muſt needs be awakened, excited, troubled; like thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Ground.</hi> It will take away the

O how it works upon their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98937:20"/>ſpirits! O how they begin to long, to love, to deſire to be with the Father of ſpirits! and how they be raviſht with the Beauties of Chriſt, ſeeing what had not been ſhewen and told them ſo before, and conſidering what they had not heard ſo before; as it is written, <hi>For that which had not been told them, ſhall they ſee; and that which they had not heard, ſhall they conſider,</hi> Iſa. 52.15.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Ground.</hi> It takes away all excuſes, vain conceits and opinions, which hinder the coming of Chriſt into their hearts; for ſome will ſay, that they cannot yet come to Chriſt, to be ſaved by Chriſt, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of buſineſs, or becauſe they are intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a wife, I mean Miſtris Pleaſure or Luſt; like thoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.13, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>And beſides theſe, there are many in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, who have a conceit and opinion, that they are come to Chriſt already, and do beleive in Chriſt when they do not, but are deceived by a miſt, or black

For this Miniſtry tells them, that no ſuch excuſes, pretences, lets, will ſerve to keep them from Jeſus Chriſt; who is better than Ground, better than Cattel, better than all the profits of all the world, and is infinitely to be preferred before Wives, Sons and Daughters; for he can ſave us, but they cannot, ſo that he may better ſay the words of <hi>Elkanah,</hi> than any man breathing, or thing exiſting, <hi>Am not I better to thee than Ten Sons,</hi> and better than Ten Wives, and better than Ten Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, nay, better than Ten thouſand Worlds, if there were ſo many.

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Ground.</hi> It acquaints men with the abſolute neceſſity of believing, I mean of believing ſavingly; for ſaith this Miniſtry, as Chriſt ſaid once, <hi>Except you eat the Heſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritually, and by a lively Faith, <hi>ye have no life in you,</hi> John 6.53. <hi>And be that helieveth not</hi> (namely, ſavingly) <hi>ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> Mark 16.16. whatſoever the man be, learned or unlearned, bond or free, rich or poor, young or old, profeſſor or no profeſſor, <hi>for there is no reſpect of perſons with God;</hi> ſo that if a man, being a profeſſor, ſhould give all his goods to the poor, pray and proſtrate himſelf at and before the Throne of Grace oftimes in a day, peruſe thoſe ſacred leaves which are in the Book of God, beyond all his neighbours, ſoar up

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Ground.</hi> It will inform them of that ſtricteſt way of living which Chriſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of all that will enter into Life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; For, ſaith this Miniſtry, as Chriſt ſaid once, <hi>Except your Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees,</hi> (who yet faſted twice a week, compaſſed Sea and Land to make a Proſelyte, made long prayers, were no Extortioners, no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, no unrighteous perſons, ſuch as Theeves, and Defrauders in bargaining, and Uſurers are; nay, as ſome write of them, lay upon boards, not beds, by night) <hi>ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> Mark; <hi>in no caſe,</hi> if you would give all your ſubſtance for it, would ſeek very much after it, would go ſo far to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as that it might be ſaid of you, as Chriſt ſaid to that young man, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mark 12.34. ſo you are not far from the Kingdom of God, yet ſhall ye in no wiſe enter, unleſs ye go farther, unleſs you go thorow, unleſs

                  <p>Again, ſaith this Miniſtry with St. <hi>James, James</hi> 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> Obſerve; <hi>whoſoever,</hi> without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whether he be a Jew or Chriſtian, Miniſter or Hearer, a great man or a poor man, how big ſoever he look, how high ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he eſteem and think of himſelf, nay though he be a man that is well eſteemed by all his neighbours in the place where he liveth, for his almes-deeds, for his kind carriage, for his peace-making among them, for his ſquare dealings with every man, and eſpecially for the good order he keeps in his own family, for praying much and often, in and with his family, and apart; for reading, for repeating of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and for catechizing his Sons, and Servants; yet if he offend in one point, if he omit or neglect any one needful Duty, live but in any one known ſin, that one <hi>but</hi> will ſpoile all, and he will be guilty of all,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98937:24"/>and ſo die for it without mercy; As if a man ſhould keep all the Laws of our Land, but kill one man, he dieth for it, if he had a thouſand lives, by the Laws of the Land: So ſtrict, ſaith this Miniſtry, is the Law of God; which when poor ſinners are acquainted with, O what fears! O what doubts! O what ſtirrings! O what cares it raiſes and cauſes in mens and womens hearts! and O what ſorce will not they uſe? and what pains, beſides all them that they have taken, will they not take, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Violence</hi> they may take? Some have made themſelves Eunuches for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.12. And ſo I do verily beleive, that ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they will be cut off from their hopes of Heaven, they will after they have heard &amp; imbibed all this into their hearts, and ears, cut off all their members which they have upon earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. I mean their deareſt ſins; as Fornication, Uncleanneſs, inordinate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, evil concupiſcence and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry; and that they will go as far as their legs, I mean the legs of Faith, will carry them, even ſo far as to the loving of their very enemies, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98937:25"/>giving of their bodies to be burnt, the loſing of their eſtates, their eaſe, their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſenſual delights, and the incurring of the hatred of all their friends, yea, of all the world, rather than go from Chriſt, and go from Life, and go from the World which is to come.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>uſes</hi> of the point will be theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>uſe,</hi> will be one of Information.</p>
                  <p>Then how deſirable muſt needs ſuch a Miniſtry be? You do all deſire, and covet to have ſuch ſervants and workmen as do their work ſo faithfully, ſo painfully, and ſo well, as that you may perceive, and ſee your ſelves, how much they do advance your eſtates on Earth; and if ſo, how much to be deſired then is that painful and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Miniſtry, which doth ſo labour to advance your ſpiritual eſtates, and your ſoules, that they may win Heaven? We read, <hi>John</hi> 5.4. that <hi>An Angel went down at a certain time, into that Pool, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the waters, and that whoſoever then firſt after the troubling of the water, ſtepped in, was made whole of what diſeaſe ſoever he had;</hi> and how much longed for the comming down
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98937:25"/>of ſuch an Angel was to the people then, eſpecially to the lame, and to the blind, and to the impotent, and to the withered, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. I leave to you to judge. Now every powerful and Chriſt-preaching-Miniſter, is ſuch an Angel: ſo he comes into the Pulpit; ſo he troubles the water, making the Word which he preacheth, to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to obſtinate and impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and ſo he cauſes it, by God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to become wholeſome to many a poor creature, that is blind, or lame, or impotent, or withered, which then and thereupon can, and will, being made whole and ſound, even offer a <hi>Sacred Violence</hi> to Heaven it ſelf, and ſtrive to take it by force; and therefore O how lovely! O how amiable! O how deſirable! O how much to be loved and longed for, muſt needs be a powerful &amp; Chriſt-preaching-Miniſtry, and thoſe Goſpel-Angels which come to us in the Name of the Lord! O how wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come muſt they needs be to ſin-ſick and ſin-lame ſouls, though they trouble them a little firſt, becauſe they come with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their preaching, and cure them at laſt, and make them to make out for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

Wherefore as thoſe Sorcerers which heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, were ſo affected with, and wrought upon with his preaching, as that they kindled a fire, and burnt their books before all men, not at all regarding
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98937:27"/>the price thereof, which amounted to fifty thouſand pieces of Silver, nor the loſs which thereby they ſuſtained, becauſe they would rather loſe their Books, and loſe their Gain, and loſe all their Silver, than loſe their Souls, and loſe Life, and loſe Heaven; Heaven being far more valued, more eſteemed, more prized of them, than all their books which were burned by them. So do ye now go, and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; ye need not kindle a fire for it, for I have kindled a fire for you already by this my preaching; for, <hi>is not my Word like Fire,</hi> ſaith God? <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. Do ye only bring, I'l not ſay your books, but your ſins, which I have preached againſt in this Sermon, and burn them before all men; that is, let the Word which I have taught you now, ſo burn them up, as that we may ſee them no more, hear of them no more, be troubled about them and with them no more; as when a thing is burnt, we are troubled with it no more: O Sirs, where are thoſe your books, I ſhould ſay yourſins, which muſt be burnt? bring them hither, and burn them here before me, in and by this Fire which I have made for you; bring hither your

Do ye not feel this Fire? O that God would work now upon your ſouls! O that he would blow this Fire! O that he would cauſe his holy Spirit to blow upon your ſpirits!

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did, when he encouraged his men againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi>) leſt they ſhould be diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But the Wiſdom of God is wiſer than the wiſdom of men; for he, becauſe he knows that hardſhips and difficulties fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewn, do put men on hazardous, bold, and venturous attempts; therefore tells us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, that it is no eaſie thing for a man to pleaſe God; that he doth moſt narrowly look after every Souldier of his, &amp; after all his doings; that Heaven cannot otherwiſe be taken, but only by <hi>Violence;</hi> and that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98937:32"/>therefore it is one of the hardeſt things in the world for any man to go about it. O Sirs, obſerve then, this great, this ſtrange, this to be admired Wiſdom of our God; who knows full well, that if he ſhould not fore-tell us ſo much, we would be apt to ſay then, when we meet with dangers, with enemies, with difficulties, <hi>Non putaramus;</hi> that is, We did not think ſo; and ſo would baſely and cowardly turn faces about, and run away. It is ſaid of <hi>Laban,</hi> that when <hi>Jacob</hi> expected to have <hi>Rachel</hi> to be given him, to be his wife, and found that it was <hi>Leah,</hi> he told him, <hi>It muſt not be ſo done in our Countrey, to give the younger before the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> Gen, 28.26. So, whereas men look for <hi>Rachel</hi> ſtill, that is, all things fair, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily tells them of <hi>Leah;</hi> that is, of things which are not ſo pleaſing to them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo fair in their eyes; and ſaith in plain terms, as <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid, It muſt not be ſo done in this Countrey, or in this world; to give men <hi>Rachel</hi> (I ſhould ſay Heaven) before <hi>Leah;</hi> that is, before they have been matcht up firſt to hardſhips, and uſed to things which they like not: <hi>Rachel</hi> is reſerved for the laſt place, and <hi>Leah</hi> for the firſt. O the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98937:33"/>infinite and incomparable Wiſdom of God in all this! for he knows that plain-dealing is beſt: Satan deals with the Sons of men far otherwiſe, for he tells them of nothing, but of all fair firſt; and afterward, when he hath them at an advantage, and thinks that he can make them irrecoverably fall, of all bad, all loſt, and therein he places and centers a great deal of his Serpentine wiſdom: but the moſt wiſe God holds it better, and takes it to be far greater Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to tell men of the worſt firſt, and of the beſt next, becauſe that uſually ſpeeds beſt; and therefore let us here take up that rare Admiration and Exclamation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, of and about the Wiſdom of God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God!

                        <hi>For none can prove or ſhew preſident, that Faith was wrought in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at firſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preparation going before.</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <hi>of</hi> Dedham, <hi>in his Doctrine of Faith.</hi> p. 63.</note> prepared for this, which puts you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing: But now be comforted, and now be perſwaded, that Chriſt will have you, if you through the Riches of his Grace will have him: O Sirs, you may believe him, that what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, he will do, <hi>for it is impoſſible ſon God to lie, Heb.</hi> 6.18. Now here, you here and ſee his Promiſes; here it lyeth in this Book; here I ſhew it to you, ſhewing you the Book, the Chapter, the Verſe wherein it lyeth, and ſhineth and ſparkles above the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98937:41"/>brightneſs of any Ruby or Diamond. O believe, believe only; for why ſhould ye not? If a woman have a mans promiſe that he will marry her, ſhe believes him becauſe of his promiſe; and will ye not believe God; having his Promiſe? Man may lie, and often doth lie; but God cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give credit to his Word, and be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in Faith, and ſo make an end once of that great match which hath been ſo long hanging betwixt Chriſt and you. O cry to him, and ſay, Lord, I ſee thou wilt needs have me, and therefore I will have thee, and no other, for my dear and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Husband; O come Lord Jeſus, and marry me this day in Faith and for ever; O for ever, for ſo thou haſt promiſed me.</p>
                  <p>Here give me leave to give you a Caveat about the Lord's Promiſe. The Promiſe is likea Staff; and you know the back-ſide of a mans hand cannot take a Staff, but let him turn the palm of his hand to the Staff, he may take it; ſo turn the right-ſide of your ſouls to the Lord's Promiſe, forcing them to believe, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> againſt hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. that is, though you have but little, or no hope, when you look upon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98937:41"/>your ſelves, and upon your great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet in hope, when you look upon God's unparalellable Goodneſs, and his, by you, undeſerved Kindneſs, and you may take it; but we turn the back-ſide of our hearts to the Promiſe, when the heart ſaith, O my ſtubbornneſs! and O my unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! this is the wrong-ſide of the heart; and this will never let you take Chriſt, but rather be a let to you, which will ever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from marrying Chriſt, and from believing in Chriſt; therefore beware of it. But I deſire to uſe one artifice more, to draw you unto Chriſt, ſo as that this very time, you may by God's Bleſſing come to believe in Chriſt. I'll deal with you, as they dealt with <hi>Rebecka,</hi> when <hi>Eleazar</hi> was come to her to have her married unto his maſters Son, they called for the Damſel, and asked her, <hi>Wilt thou go with this man, Gen.</hi> 24.58. So will I call to you now, being come for you to marry you to my Maſters Son, even to Chriſt, that heavenly <hi>I ſaac,</hi> will you go with me? will you follow me? Will you come after me to my Maſters Son, Chriſt? I mean the Son of God; Formerly I did but perſwade you, but now I come
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98937:42"/>nearer home to your hearts and boſomes, and ask you what you will do, expecting an anſwer: anſwer therefore, O ye men of <hi>T</hi>—and all you that hear me; and anſwer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you in his heart, what ye intend to do; loe, I give you time, what ſay ye? will ye go, or not? believe, or not believe? be married to Chriſt, or not be married? if you have a mind to it indeed by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand, and Power of God upon you, though fleſh and blood be utterly againſt it, and ſay nay to it, yet do you ſay as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccka,</hi> now after all this, every one of you, <hi>I will go, I will go.</hi> ver. 58. come what will come, though all my friends be againſt it; though my unbelief do gain-ſay it; though my ſluggiſh fleſh do diſwade me from it; and though ſin and devils do as much as they can oppoſe me in it, O ſweet Jeſus, loe I come, though it be long firſt, yet now at laſt I come to take thee for my moſt dear and only Saviour, Lord and Husband; O take me ſweet Saviour, and let me be thine, and be thou mine; as it is written, <hi>My Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine, and I am his;</hi> yea, and <hi>feed</hi> me <hi>among the Lillies;</hi> that is, with thy <hi>Lillies;</hi> or celeſtial Conſolations, which for their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98937:42"/>cooling &amp; refreſhing, are like Lillies, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. O ſouls, ſouls, is this your mind? your purpoſe, your reſolution this day? if it be, then ſay all of you <hi>Amen</hi> to it, in your hearts, I intreat you, and beſpeak you about it once more. O my God, if this people have ſuch an heart given them this day, then bleſſed be thy holy name for it, now and for ever; if not, give them ſuch a heart now, before I leave them, that by believing and loving, they may be in thee, and thou in them, I humbly and heartily obſecrate and beſeech thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Repenting;</hi> that is, ſorrowing for ſin, and confeſſing, and forſaking of ſin: which parts of true and ſound repentance in this place, I chiefly aim at, the one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us lower then we were, the other <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> both are <hi>bitter;</hi> but better it is for all to taſt of their bitterneſs now, than to ſuffer for the want of them hereafter.</p>

O far be it from ſuch as ſome of ye be, Pretenders, I mean, to the taking of Heaven by Violence: The more difficult the work is, the greater will be your glory, if ye ſet your ſelves in good earneſt to it, and the greater your reward; for by it we turn Eagles; and like Eagles, towr up, and

O I muſt needs be caſt away, and be ſuffocated, and drowned in thoſe mercileſs waters of woe and miſery which are about me, and are even ready to ſwallow me, ready to drown me! O woe, woe is me becauſe of Unbelief! for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that ever Chriſt gave himſelf for me: If this man be told by one of a thouſand, that he hopes better things of him, and that his ſtriving to come to Chriſt, is an argument that there is Faith in him, though it be ſo little as that he ſeeth it not; he ſaith and replieth again, Yes, I cannot but acknowledge that ſome Faith there is in me, but I fear that it is but a dogmatical or hiſtorical, or temporary Faith, and ſo

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Caſe.</hi> The firſt is; Sir, we have heard all this, and yet there is no ſtirring after all this, ſome will ſay; and therefore what ſhall we do in this Caſe?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer in four Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There may be no ſtirring with ſome of you, becauſe you are not yet effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, and ſpoken to, nor yet blown upon by the Spirit of God, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. like thoſe dry bones in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.2. even very dry, ſo as that there was no ſtirring among them at all; till after, when the Prophet propheſied to them, and the Wind, that is the Spirit of God, which is like Wind, did breath upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> There may be no ſtirring with ſome of you as yet, becauſe your time is not come yet; ſome are called the third, ſome the ſixth hour, ſome the ninth, ſome the eleventh hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.3, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> If there be no ſtirring with you, becauſe you are not yet effectually called, nor have been blown upon by the Spirit of God, then you muſt pray to the Lord, that this my preaching now at laſt, may work upon you, and there may be a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98937:73"/>ſtirring among you: as thus; O our God, ſay, Let this man's preaching to us belike <hi>Ezekiels</hi> propheſying; For Lord, haſt not thou ſent him, ſaying, Go and propheſie to theſe dead dry bones, which are in that Town of <hi>T</hi>—that they may live? and wilt not thou bleſs his propheſying to our ſouls? O that there were a ſhaking among us, as there was among thoſe bones! O moſt mighty God, let there be ſuch a ſhaking, and ſuch a ſtirring among us, now at laſt, after all this propheſying, that we may ſtand upon our feet, as a great and terrible Army with Banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.11. and take Heaven by Force. Or thus, As <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17. <hi>And now I beſeech thee, let the Power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken: So let every one of you now cry, and ſay to Lord, And now I beſeech thee, let the Power of my Lord be great, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> So let every one of you, now cry and ſay to the Lord; And now I beſeech thee, let the Power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſaying, <hi>I will cauſe breath to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and ye ſhall live,</hi> Ezek. 37.5. and, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98937:73"/>verily I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God; and they that hear, ſhall live, John</hi> 5.24. Lord, I am dead; cauſe me to hear his Voice, this hour, this time, that I may ſtir, and live: O this <hi>ſtirring,</hi> it is that which muſt work, muſt move our hearts, muſt remove our affections, muſt elevate our ſpirits, muſt collocate our ſouls in a capacity and ability to attain to high atchivements; and therefore I adviſe you ſo much, and perſwade you ſo earneſtly to beg it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> But if your time be not yet come; as it is ſaid of thoſe Figs, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.13. <hi>For the time of Figs was not yet;</hi> then you muſt even wait, till that Goſpel-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſhall come, which ſhall move the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that is, your affections, ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that you may ſtir; as thoſe blind, and lame, and impotent ones, at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda, John</hi> 5.3, 4. and till the Spirit of God himſelf ſhall come, and move upon the waters of your affections effectually; as he did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. to produce and to bring
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98937:74"/>forth a new Creation, even your Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which God in mercy grant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Caſe.</hi> The ſecond Caſe is this, But ſuppoſe there be a ſtirring amongſt us ſince you preached thus, ſo as that many of the things which you preſſed, have been done among us; may not all that be in vain? and if ſo, what ſhall we do in ſuch a caſe?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer three wayes.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Granting.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Diſcovering.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Adviſing.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Granting</hi> that you may ſtir, and do many things in vain; for, <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. And did not <hi>Herod</hi> ſtir, and perform and reform many things in vain? <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſcovering;</hi> namely, the Cauſes why you may ſtir, and do many things in vain:</p>
                  <p>For firſt, You may build without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; that is, you may want a due deep and ſufficient Humiliation, ſo much requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.9, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You may refuſe to go thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98937:74"/>As <hi>Herod,</hi> who kept his <hi>Herodias, Mark</hi> 6.22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You may truſt to your doings; as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. Which you may know by theſe two Signes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. If you be proud upon your doings, as the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who ſo boaſted of his faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice a week, and of his paying of tithes duely, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. If you preſume upon your doings, ſo as that you make bold thereupon with one ſin or other; as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who truſting in themſelves, deſpiſed others, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9. That ſin of deſpiſing others, went with their truſting to their doings, and in themſelves. Beloved, if a baſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low abuſe a Kings Son, men are apt to ſay, Surely ſome body upholds this fellow, and he truſts to that, elſe he durſt not do ſo: So we may ſay of men and women, that abuſe the Son of God, with one ſin or other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſome baſe luſt, or paſſion, or uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or pride, or wrong, thereby doing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to the Son of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. and and to the Spirit of Grace; certainly thoſe men truſt to their doings, to their prayers,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98937:75"/>to their going to Church, that upholds them, and upon that they are ſo bold to do as they do, elſe they durſt not; they hope that theſe their doings and duties will bear them out: as doubtleſs <hi>Herod</hi> thought ſo too, when he kept his <hi>Herodias, Mark</hi> 6.22.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You may depend upon your ſayings: As for example; Becauſe you can ſay, and have ſaid, Lord we believe; help our unbelief; and our Beloved is ours, and we are his: As I taught you in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions to ſay, you may think that therefore you do believe, when you do not, but only ſay that you do believe. This is notably ſet out by St. <hi>James, What doth it profit, my Brethren, though a man ſaith that he hath Faith?</hi> Jam. 2.14. Mark: <hi>Though he ſay;</hi> Which ſheweth, that, as it is now, ſo it was then; there were men, who thought that they had Faith, becauſe they could ſay, and did ſay, that they did believe: That was their Faith; and that is moſt mens Faith now
<note n="‡" place="margin">
                        <hi>The World is now, as it was in Ages paſt.</hi> Rel. Medici. p. 12.</note>: And therefore, O the infinite Deceits, and Fallacies of that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent!
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98937:75"/>O the unfathomable Mazes of his Devices! O the abyſs and depth of his Subtilties! Thouſands have been ſo delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him: and millions there are now in Hell, ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire, becauſe they have hearkened to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Adviſing,</hi> I ſay Adviſing you, that,</p>
                  <p>It, 1. You want Humiliation, and have not yet been duly, deeply and ſufficiently dejected, and ſo have built without a good foundation, you lay ſuch a foundation yet, for elſe how can your building ſtand? If a Houſe or Caſtle be not founded upon a ſure Foundation, we know it cannot ſtand, but muſt needs totter, and come down: And ſo muſt all that which you do, come to nothing, if this Foundation be wanting; l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke that Seed which wanted deepneſs of earth; whereby we may underſtand depth of Humiliation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.5. and therefore be humbled, nay deeply and ſufficiently humbled, for all the evils of your wayes; nay, <hi>for the evil</hi> even of your holy things, and doings, and be not quiet till you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, nor reſt till you cannot reſt, nor give
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98937:76"/>over, I mean humbling your ſelves, till you be come over to that depth of ſorrow, which your horrid miſcarriages, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours call for; In a word, as <hi>David</hi> and his men wept, till they could weep no more, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.4. So do you grieve till you can grieve no more; for
<note n="*" place="margin">Nam ultra poſſe fiery, Non vult lex ulla requiri.</note> then God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no more. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you never went thorow-ſtich yet, then go farther, and thorow yet; for how many have come ſhort of Chriſt, and Heaven, becauſe they would not do a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more? even as ſome miſs ſometimes, and go without a good bargain, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, becauſe they will not give the other pound, or piece; nay, ſometimes ſome part for a groat: O do not you ſo too; but if any thing be yet wanting, add it, if a little more be required, do it; if a little more muſt be given for Chriſt and Heaven, give it; O do not go without it for a ſmal matter, give the other groat, I pray you; &amp; let it not be ſaid of you, that you left Chriſt, Life and Salvation for a groat, that is, for a ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98937:76"/>becauſe you would not do a little more, and go a little further; pray a little more, meditate a little more, and do ſomewhat elſe more, which ye never did yet. O Sirs, I muſt needs preſs you to this; for ſo runs my Commiſſion, <hi>Teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, Mat.</hi> 28.20. So that needs you muſt do all that, which in my former Directions I have taught you, and which Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath any where enjoyned you, though it be never ſo croſs, and contrary to your depraved natures, if you would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you formerly truſted to your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, do ſo no more, but ſay as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was taught to ſay, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us,</hi> Hoſ. 14.3. So Prayer ſhall not ſave us, Faſting ſhall not ſave us; could we ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels, could we ſet open our eyes, like Sluces, with weeping, could we ſoar up in the penſiveneſs of our thoughts like Eagles, and thereby even peep into Heaven, yet ſhould we not be juſtified thereby: And therefore we truſt to be ſaved only by our Lord and Saviour
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98937:77"/>Jeſus Chriſt, and by his infinite, and by us undeſerved, Mercy, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you relyed on your ſayings, go farther hereafter, and do not only ſay, that you do believe, but labour to believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; that is, never be ſatisfied in that point, nor think that yo do believe, till you ſee Faith to be in you, by its effects wrought in you; I mean, 1. <hi>Love.</hi> 2. <hi>Holineſs.</hi> And, 3. <hi>Pureneſs.</hi> For it is like <hi>Sarah,</hi> it will have out <hi>Hagar;</hi> that is, ſlaviſh and ſervile Fears, and all the Luſts of the Fleſh, with the Affections thereof; and like <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> it will overlay the Temple of the holy Ghoſt all with Gold; that is, it will make us all glorious within, nay, throughout, both within and without; even glorious in Holineſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and glorious in Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <p>Need you Incentives after all my Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Solutions given you? then take theſe.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that that Kingdom of Heaven, which I perſwade you ſo much to take by Force, is a Kingdom which is,

And how far it is from thence to the Empyrean Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who can tell? no man living. The Scripture therefore calls Heaven, <hi>Heights, Pſal.</hi> 148.1. and ſaith further, that <hi>Heaven for Height is unſearchable, Prov.</hi> 25.3. So that no Thieves can approach it, no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98937:78"/>aſſault it, no Wars reach it. There may be another reaſon given for this, why Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is above the reach of all its oppoſites, becauſe it is not to be ſeen, being far above all aſpectable Heavens, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. The
<note n="†" place="margin">Fratres Roſeae Crucis.</note> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Red Croſs, as they call themſelves, give out (as I have read it in one of their own printed Books) that the houſe of their meeting is not to be ſeen, which I queſtion, whether they ſpeak true in it (though they ſay, that they are of the pureſt Proteſtants) But this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, that the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens is a place which by us here cannot be ſeen; for, <hi>the eye hath not ſeen the things</hi> (whereof this Heaven is one) <hi>prepared for thoſe that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. If then, ye will be a in ſafe &amp; ſecure place indeed, which may not be lyable to ſurprizals; then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this Kingdom, to take it by <hi>force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For its Terms, upon which it muſt be taken by us: For what are the Terms upon which it ſtands, think ye? the Terms of it are ſuch as theſe, <hi>They that will enter me,</hi> ſaith this Kingdom, <hi>muſt exceed in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98937:78"/>Righteouſneſs, even the ſtricteſt Phariſees that ever lived; For except your Righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. <hi>and ye muſt be perfect, as God is perfect,</hi> ſaith this Kingdom, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. Now, if ſome men were to ſerve as Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Captain, or General, who promiſes them, that they ſhall have for their Service, whatſoever they take, though it be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but that they muſt do more work than all other ordinary Souldiers, muſt wake when others ſleep, muſt faſt when others feaſt; they would all ſay, O what high and hard terms be theſe! And yet to win a Kingdom, be perſwaded to ſerve ſuch a General, and even <hi>force</hi> themſelves to it, and take extraordinary pains for it, becauſe the Terms propoſed are ſo high, as that otherwiſe they cannot have it. And ſo ſhould we <hi>force</hi> our ſelves to win the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and take extraordinary pains for it, becauſe of the high Terms of it, and becauſe elſe we ſhall never enter it, unleſs we do more work than all other

                  <p>O Souls, Souls, are ye nothing moved yet with all this? I hope you are; nay, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you are by your attention; if ye be, then move, and move indeed; I mean ſo ſtrongly, ſo vigorouſly, ſo effectually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, to take it by Force, as that the world may ſee your change, your zeal, your forwardneſs, your labouring for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Heaven ye ſee is even at hand; as the Baptiſt ſaid once, <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand,</hi> when he ſo preached it up, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. it was ſo, and ſo it is now, and

                  <p>Only give me leave, Much Honoured Lady, to give you a ſhort Account of this my preſent Undertaking. Theſe late Times are and have been very ſickly, and many every where are fallen aſleep; and when the time of our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be, the Lord only knoweth: and we our ſelves alſo know this, that it cannot
<pb facs="tcp:98937:87"/>be long before we likewiſe ſhal go to our long home, and be no more ſeen at our preſent homes, becauſe our life is but <hi>a vapour,</hi> Jam. <hi>4.14. and we flie away,</hi> Pſal. <hi>90.10.</hi> which not with ſtanding, how few are there which prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for that time; <hi>Cogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes de fine infinito, ut vivant in infinitum:</hi> VVhence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs, that moſt men, when after they have lived a careleſs life, they come to be unmanned by Death, they go <hi>Imparati in locum paratum,</hi> Unprepared to a place prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

                     <hi>idque in aeternum,</hi> and that for ever; for that which ends All, is without end. And their neareſt friends are much the cauſe of it; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faſhion of Friends is to put their friends in mind of Death, when they doubt that they can live no longer; <hi>Zenas</hi> the Lawyer, and <hi>Luke</hi> the Phyſician, must have given them over, before they will ſend for <hi>Barnabas</hi> to give them good Counſel and ſolid Conſolation against their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.

                  <p>My deſign in this Tract is this, To tell men plainly that ſhortly they must put off their caribly Tabernacles, &amp; ſhew them evidently, How they must die whilst they live, that they may live when they die; dying in, by, and according to Faith. This, this I aimed at when I penned this Treatiſe; which, if it be acted by Faith, will ſo work upon mens and womens precious ſouls, and do them ſo much good, as that they will even long to enjoy the chiefest good; and when their work here is done, will
<pb facs="tcp:98937:89"/>ſhew them Heaven open for them; where there is health only, and no ſickneſs; living, and no dying; incorruption, and no corruption; eaſe, and no pain; ſinging, and no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing; <hi>For the former things are paſſed away,</hi> Rev. <hi>21.4.</hi>

                  <p>In the beginning of this Moſt Excellent Chapter, the holy Apoſtle deſcribeth Faith by three ſeveral Effects.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That it procreates and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a ſure and certain hope of things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Almighty God, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, That by Faith men pleaſe God, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98937:91"/>
                  <p>The third is, That we believe things to humane reaſon incredible, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Which done, he illuſtrates and brighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſaid Effects by Examples prompted out of the Sacred Book of God.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all, he produceth ſome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who flouriſhed before the Flood; as <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> ver. 4, 5, 6, 7. to prove both the ſecond and third effect; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> the third by <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards he deſcends to a ſecond Claſs of Examples, reckoning up ſuch ancient Fathers as lived after the Flood, before <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt; Abraham,</hi> I mean, <hi>Iſaac, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> to confirm the firſt Effect, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Having explained the ſaid Examples, he ſuper-adds an Amplification, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the words of my Text, declaring that the forementioned ancient <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and Believers, were both moſt certain in their Hope, and conſtant in their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Impletion of the Lord's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which he had made unto them; <hi>For they dyed in Faith,</hi> ſaith he, ſuch was their conſtancy.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98937:92"/>
                  <p>And thus you may ſee the coherence of theſe words with the former.</p>
                  <p>Two things we may note in the Text it ſelf, which is a Sacred Narration.

                     <p>As now I go to my bed, ſo I muſt go to my Grave; and as I put off my Cloaths, ſo ere long, nay this night it may be, I muſt put off my Earthly Tabernacle, which is my Body; and as I ſhall fall aſleep, and know nothing that is done while I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, ſo muſt I very ſhortly ſleep up, and die, not knowing any thing that ſhall be done here about me, or with me, or to me; nor can or will any Sanctity or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that is in me, be able to deliver me from the fatal ſtroak of Death, which will ſteal upon me like ſleep; for the very God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt die as well as others.</p>

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="2">2. They that ſhall follow theſe Rules, ſhall fix their minds upon the Lord's never-failing Promiſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one of the ſaid Rules; and therefore they muſt needs be very quiet, ſtayed and firm, for the Promiſes are moſt firm, even <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt, 2 Cor. 1.20. and therefore they that ſtay themſelves in them, muſt needs be ſo too; even as he that buildeth upon a Rock
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98937:135"/>builded firmly, and as he that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a Rock ſtands firmly: Hence, when an holy Man was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how he could paſs his laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo without any trouble? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That he did ever eye that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent promiſe, in</hi> Eſa. 26.3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe be truſteth in thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, that ſome holy Walkers and eminent Believers, as Mr. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peacock,</hi> and others, have been much troubled for all this in their latter end, which may ſeem to croſs what I have ſaid, but their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was not perpetual.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Was rather a kind of peace, then a war; for their trouble was a war with Satan. Now our war

                     <p>I cloſe up therefore the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſecond Incentive with a Speech, like unto that which an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Interpreter made to King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> asking him, <hi>How he might be at reſt when he Dreamed?</hi>

                     <p>Whereas careful providers for death rather,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Blow up the good motions and workings of the Spirit, as much as in them lyeth, by their careful and holy walking, and applying of the Lord's Promiſes; ſo that needs they muſt feel more joy and comfort then others that do not ſo, even as one that bloweth up Coals doth feel more heat then he which ſuffers them to go out.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Pleaſe the Spirit of God, and cheriſh his motions by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his Nature, in that they labour to be as Spiritual as poſſible they may, and ſo conſequently to partake of his Nature; ſo as that

See <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. how therefore they that <hi>walked in the fear of the Lord,</hi> are alſo ſaid to <hi>walk in the Comforts of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such are moſt fit for comfort and joy. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The muchneſs of Grace which is <hi>in</hi> them, and procedeth <hi>from</hi> them, cannot but be evidently ſeen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98937:138"/>by them, and cauſe them to joy in it, and to be even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad for it, like a man that hath and finds a treaſure that was hid in his field, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. Now the finding of ſuch a Treaſure will chear up the heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The enlargment of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires and endeavours cannot but procure joy, which is an

                     </p>
                     <p>So <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> Martyr, at
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98937:140"/>his death; I <hi>believe there is not a merrier heart in the world at this inſtant than mine.
